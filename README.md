# 8bit - Conway's Game of Life

> BubbleFish Studio is a multidisciplinary studio making applied music and sound design with an eye to propagating knowledge and culture.

This repository contains the source materials for the creation of the first day of the "Music Creation Challenge 2022" we started on our [Instagram](https://instagram.com/bubblefishstudio).

The final video can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CYPHSRYATTo/).

## Video

The video is generated using the Processing sketch in `./sketch_8bit_game_of_life` using a custom configuration for the game of life where:

- 1 or 2 neighbors keep a cell alive
- 1 neighboor make a dead cell become alive

The neighborhood configuration is the typical Moore neighborhood (i.e. 8 cells around)

## Music

The music track is made using the provided Logic Pro X project, composed by 5 tracks of oscillators:

- lead: triangular oscillator
- harmony: sawtooth oscillator + tiny bit of rectangular sub
- kick: triangle + white noise + lowpass + bitcrusher
- snare: rectangular (duty cycle almost 0) + white noise + bitcrusher
- bell: rectangular (duty cycle almost 0) + lowpass + bitcrusher
